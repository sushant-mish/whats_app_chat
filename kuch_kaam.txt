Should we consider complexity analysis at  this stage where most of us are beginners?

28/01/2020, 7:25 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Guys today's q.
28/01/2020, 7:25 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): All the elements of the input array will be consisting of '0' s and '1' s.
You have to output a single line 
With all the 1's and then remaining 0's of the input array.

Input format :
Take n,After that next line contains, n spaced integers i.e a1,a2...an  denoting the elements of the array.

Output format :
Print a single line consisting of length n.

Sample input:
6
0 1 0 1 0 1

Sample output:
1 1 1 0 0 0

Explaination :
As we can see there are 3 ones and 3 zeros in the input array,So output is accordingly.
28/01/2020, 7:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Just a note
28/01/2020, 7:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Haan will try
28/01/2020, 7:29 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): .

28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
 Plz
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): It has something to do with how second condition of B is placed.
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - +91 99201 75875: Assuming you're not supposed to used in built sort functions right?
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Because if you reverse it. Write k first and then i
28/01/2020, 7:31 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): You get a totally different output
28/01/2020, 7:31 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): How???
28/01/2020, 7:39 pm - Tushar Nankani: Can you send the complete code? What is in the second printf?

28/01/2020, 7:47 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): In-built
28/01/2020, 7:48 pm - Tushar Nankani: Because it enters the loop because of k. And i gets printed too.
28/01/2020, 7:49 pm - Tushar Nankani: The condition of k becomes true and therefore it enters the loop. From 2 to 20 with a gap of 2. Therefore it enters 10 times and i gets printed instead from 1-10
28/01/2020, 7:50 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): So conclusion is
If there are multiple conditions in a single ' for loop' then even if one statement is satisfied then loop will run for that condition.
28/01/2020, 7:51 pm - Tushar Nankani: Yes. It's like any one of these conditions should be true. It's like using "OR". And not "AND".
28/01/2020, 7:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But depends na

One more thing 

We've gotta manage our academics also along with coding 

I know pointers don't matter much

But getting a decent pointer is important.....

If you all can 
You'll should allocate specific time for coding....

29/01/2020, 10:47 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): This is because 52 (i.e. 25) might be stored as 24.9999999 or 25.0000000001 because the return type is double. When assigned to int, 25.0000000001 becomes 25 but 24.9999999 will give output 24.
To overcome this and output the accurate answer in integer format, we can add 0.5 to the result and typecast it to int e.g (int)(pow(5, 2)+0.5) will give the correct answer(25, in above example), irrespective of the compiler.

29/01/2020, 10:56 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): for 24.9999999 when you typecast it into int then it will be roundoff to 24 but if you add 0.5 you will be safe even if it's 25.000000001

29/01/2020, 11:43 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): darshan sir told us to avoid statements like break if possible since it causes halt in the flow of the program abruptly and causes voltage fluctuations  (just telling this to you),so just keep that in mind

29/01/2020, 11:44 pm - +91 99201 75875: Break is a really really common statement and is present in all programs

29/01/2020, 11:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It was some other editor

29/01/2020, 11:48 pm - +91 99201 75875: Let's say this is true then you could use the same logic and instead of writing it in main(),  make a separate function which just returned a Boolean and in the if statement replace break with return false and return true if the entire loop executes 
And in main just call the function with the user input int

08/02/2020, 10:31 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Sorry 2^no of bits-1 for unsigned
08/02/2020, 10:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And - 2^(no of bits-1) to 2^(no bits-1) -1 for signed
08/02/2020, 10:35 pm - +91 89764 07509: for int byte size req is 2 so since 1 byte =8 bits hence 2bytes=16 bits
08/02/2020, 10:35 pm - +91 89764 07509: therefore  2^(16)/2=32768
08/02/2020, 10:37 pm - +91 89764 07509: bro its 2^no of bits only
08/02/2020, 10:37 pm - +91 89764 07509: this you said was correct
08/02/2020, 10:37 pm - +91 89764 07509: for range
08/02/2020, 10:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I meant (2^no of bits) -1
08/02/2020, 10:37 pm - +91 89764 07509: oooohh accha then its correctüëçüèª

In C/C++ even after using the 'long long int' data type, we can compute factorial upto 20. 

Today's challenge is to write a program in C/C++ to calculate fatorial of a number 'N'

where 0 <= N <= 100

0! = 1
1! = 1
50! = 30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000

12/02/2020, 8:40 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): My tips:
1)First get firm with language.
2)Do some good implementation q's.
3)In case your code gets *tle* just try to optimize by removing unnecessary nested for loops.

It is an easier one. Then to that one
14/02/2020, 7:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Today's Challenge:

You are given a *sorted* array NUM of *integers* as input.

You have to generate a *sorted* array SQ of the *squares* of the *integers* of the given array.

Constraints:

1 <= length(NUM) <= 10000
-10000 <= element of NUM <= 10000

This can be done in linear time complexity.

14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): can be done using  better logic
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): only 1 for loop

19/02/2020, 3:51 pm - Ankit (TSEC, CS): so the random characters should just be alphabets ?
19/02/2020, 3:54 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What if the string has more than 18 characters?
19/02/2020, 3:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What about duplicate letters?

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.

 

*Input:*

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.

 

*Output:*

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!

 

*Constraints:*

1 < N < 105

0 < Ak < 109

21/02/2020, 12:41 am - Tushar Nankani: Sussutu is a world-renowned magician. And recently, he was blessed with the power to remove EXACTLY ONE element from an array.

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.

 

*Input:*

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.

 

*Output:*

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!

 

*Constraints:*

1 < N < 105

0 < Ak < 109
21/02/2020, 12:42 am - Tushar Nankani: Take a string as an input from the user.
Make a new string of length 18 characters, containing random characters and the new string should also contain each and every letter of the input string(also distributed randomly).
Example
Input:
Controller
Output:

22/02/2020, 10:05 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower you Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.

Many of us are  used to coding in an IDE or Text editor 
the environment of Hackerrank/Codechef/Codeforces is very different 
So a little into to that will be great
Like, most of the times, our solution is correct but because we did not print output in the way they wanted, it shows an error

Consider testcases
make for loops and all

23/02/2020, 1:01 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

01/03/2020, 10:57 am - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Instructions for the mashup:
You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

01/03/2020, 11:02 am - +91 79770 56210: Where can we find the conventions which we have to follow like using int main return 0 instead of void main
01/03/2020, 11:03 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): use int main return 0
01/03/2020, 11:03 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): instead of void main
01/03/2020, 11:03 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): for some weird reason this doesn't work
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - +91 79770 56210: But r there any other things that we need to know like this one
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): No, nothing else
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): .
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - +91 79770 56210: Ok
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): when you use void main program keeps on running?
01/03/2020, 11:05 am - +91 79770 56210: It runs in the ide but when i submit it it gives runtime error
01/03/2020, 11:08 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): i guess CodeForces's compiler expects a return value 0 to be returned from every program. If 0 is returned, it means program has been executed successfully. If anything other than that means something is wrong with the code.
01/03/2020, 11:09 am - +91 79770 56210: Ohk
01/03/2020, 11:09 am - +91 99693 94098: void main never worked with C89 or C99 anyway
Woh waise bhi error dega hi

03/03/2020, 10:30 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): If a[i] % m = a[j] % m for some i < j, then answer is 0. Otherwise there are <= m numbers, so you can calculate answer in O(N^2).

Integer.parseInt(in.readLine()); //for integer
in.readLine() //for String```

05/03/2020, 1:59 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This message was deleted
05/03/2020, 2:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Because they have several disadvantages as well.
For example, in C++,
```cin.tie(NULL)``` means that you can input data while the program is printing to the screen.
```ios::sync_with_stdio(false)``` does not sync ```cout``` with ```printf```.

08/03/2020, 1:59 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

15/03/2020, 11:48 am - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

15/03/2020, 11:58 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Example 2: This shows the creation and import of user-defined file.

Creating a user-defined header by the name of ‚Äúprocess.h‚Äù.
// It is not recommended to put function definitions 
// in a header file. Ideally there should be only 
// function declarations. Purpose of this code is 
// to only demonstrate working of header files. 

  

void add(int a, int b) 
{ 

    printf("Added value=%d\n", a + b); 
} 

  

void multiply(int a, int b) 
{ 

    printf("Multiplied value=%d\n", a * b); 
} 
Created the main file where the above ‚Äúprocess.h‚Äù will be included.
// C program to illustrate file inclusion 
// <> used to import system header file 
#include <stdio.h> 

  
// " " used to import user-defined file 
#include "process.h" 

  
// main function 

int main() 
{ 

    // add function defined in process.h 

    add(10, 20); 

  

    // mult function defined in process.h 

    mult(10, 20);

1. hackerRank
2. HackerEarth
3. Codechef
4. Codeforces

Please start practicing on hackerRank and HackerEarth first
Get comfortable with it and then on codechef and codeforces

Otherwise problems on codechef and codeforces are enough to make u feel demotivated .
Although there certain programmers specially like Abdullah Aslam 7 Star coder on codechef who directly started with codechef but i don't recommend that follow a straight and simple way and progress gradually.
17/03/2020, 1:16 pm - +91 73043 57388: Ok everyone so let's start
Road to CP
1. First thing u have to do is to make a firm and strong decision whether u really wanna do CP or not.
Reason why I am telling u this is because many people just do it because their classmates are doing CP and they appear to be alien in that field which is not the correct reason to do something.
Let me tell u one thing very honestly if u want job in product based companies of Software development engineer position u need to have good problem solving skills at any cost whatsoever and excellent knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms.
If u are doing CP like I opened my laptop today and I am opening it after 20 days it's not gonna work like that way if ur serious about CP then u have to chalk a good week plan be consistent and steadfast in it.
Sometimes it may happen that u become demotivated and left CP for a month or so BUT it should happen only sometimes and u should try to come back as soon as possible
2. How to start , learn only C++ and do CP only in C++. C++ is the best language for CP.
3. For those who don't want to go for any course(which I don't recommend)
Check out this video

This is one of the most common questions about which students remain confused 
"How to manage projects development and CP?"
Check out Rachit jain answer
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: One Important thing u have to insure that will doing CP ur growth and problem solving should increase exponentially.
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: Please make sure u watch this video only after u have started with C++ and covered a large topics on it 
Otherwise trees linked list all this things might become confusing for u.

But if ur in Second year ofcourse DSA has been covered in college so u should try to get comfortable with c++ within 2-3 weeks if u dont know c++ and then u can follow that with DSA
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: For FE students:
In college C language is covered by now,right? So learning c++ will be very easy BUT before properly learning c++ fundementals such as loops,arrays, strings, recursion, dynamic memory allocation etc and practicing questions on these topics 
Don't dare to jump on DSA.
For Second year:
Ur now stepping in third after a few months so u should better take a placement course because if u delay now things will become overwhelming because u have to Also focus on projects and when it comes to placement along with problem solving skills they will check ur knowledge of Object oriented programming, Database management, Operating System, computer networks. Many people will tell u that u don't need to take any placement course right now there is much time for campus placement but according to my experience it's better if u take a course and start preparing right away from placement point of u because till next year u can become not only a good programmer but also u will be prepared thoroughly for Campus interviews.
What u need to know about placements is that cracking interviews and CP are different things in interviews they don't expect or even bother whether ur a super competitive programmer or a 1 star programmer(although mentioning hackerRank Ranks, codechef ratings will ofcourse give golden layer to ur resume) But what they expect from u is u should be able to solve the interview problems with optimised solutions and try to think even if ur not able to solve the problem.
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: About courses

Companies do see ur Website profile specially hackerRank while if u Solve practice contest questions on codechef ur rating is not gonna increase as far as I know ratings codechef increases only when we participate and solve in long challenge, lunchtime and cookoff.
Rest as u wish practicing is important anyway

18/03/2020, 3:00 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Java
18/03/2020, 3:01 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): When you create an object in Java, you always call a constructor.
```Object obj = new Object()```
18/03/2020, 3:01 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is an *explicit* call.
18/03/2020, 3:02 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In C++, you can have:
```Object obj``

18/03/2020, 11:27 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): This is an implicit call for the constructor.
You never explicitly call the constructor.
When you create a new obj of a class, you invoke the constructor of that class implicitly.
18/03/2020, 11:29 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Okay you can call another constructor explicitly from a constructor, but not otherwise.

18/03/2020, 12:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, yes, this is instantiation of an object, but how is this an implicit call?

You, the programmer, is explicitly writing ```new Object()```.

If this is an implicit call, then can you please give an example of an explicit call.
18/03/2020, 12:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Did you read the article?

I think that it is about constructor overloading using ```this```.
18/03/2020, 7:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://youtu.be/0CDKwzf0JxM
18/03/2020, 7:09 pm - +91 97739 65140: Ok so this is how I have learnt it.
In Java if you write Obj object, it implicitly and in your class if there is no constructor,then javac automatically puts a non-paratmeterized constructor in your class
Hence, implicit call
*But* ,if you define a constructor in your class ,it is you who explicitly define it and hence that constructor will be used by javac in your program for object instantiation.
18/03/2020, 7:10 pm - +91 97739 65140: The second case will be explicit creation
18/03/2020, 7:10 pm - +91 97739 65140: *call
18/03/2020, 7:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You are mixing the default (implicit) constructor *definition* with implicit *calling*.
18/03/2020, 7:26 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
18/03/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): When you define a class and do not provide a constructor, Java implicitly defines the default constructor.

But when you declare an object as ```Object obj```, *no constructor is called* and ```obj = null```.
18/03/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is unlike C++, where the non parameterized constructor is called implicitly.

21/03/2020, 1:18 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.
Good luck!

25/03/2020, 10:22 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
25/03/2020, 10:28 am - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): O(nlogn)?
25/03/2020, 10:29 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): No idea
25/03/2020, 11:36 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): O(n)
25/03/2020, 11:38 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Koi bhi ek axis choose karo(let's say +y)
Then we need to find max n 2nd max point of +y
25/03/2020, 11:39 am - Vivek (TSEC, CS): No it wont work.
25/03/2020, 11:40 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Y?
25/03/2020, 11:41 am - Vivek (TSEC, CS): Even if choose max and second max,the third max point can lie on the other side.
25/03/2020, 11:42 am - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Wont work ig
